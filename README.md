This is a port program with elixir driver for serial communication.

The C code was originally written by Johan Bevemyr in 1996 and
sporadically maintained by Tony Garnock-Jones from 2007 onwards.

## Examples
### Opening a port
```elixir
{:ok, serial} = Serial.start_link

Serial.open(serial, "/dev/ttyS0")
Serial.set_speed(serial, 57600)
Serial.connect(serial)
```

### Sending data
```elixir
Serial.send_data(serial, <<0x01, 0x02, 0x03>>)
```

### Receiving data
```elixir
def handle_info({:elixir_serial, serial, data}, state) do
# do something with the data
end
```
